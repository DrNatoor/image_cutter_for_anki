# Anki Card Automation

### Anki

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a program which makes remembering things easy.
You can create your own flashcards, the rest is done by anki.

### Problem

I want to make some Anki Cards out of [this PDF](http://mathphys-online.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/z_Zusfassung_lin-alg-geometrie.pdf) 
because i need to learn for my A-levels... but just to make lots of screen captures seems very boring to me.

### Solution

Just throw some python on it!
